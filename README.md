# Company System Program

## Description
This is my first full project, created by **Rawan Arby**. It is a simple employee management system written in C++ that allows users to:
- Add new employees
- View all employees
- Delete employees by age range
- Update employee salary by name
- Exit the program

## Features
1. **Add New Employee**: 
   - Users can input employee name, age, salary, and gender.
   
2. **Print All Employees**:
   - Displays a list of all employees who have not been removed.
   
3. **Delete Employees by Age**:
   - Users can input an age range, and all employees within that range will be marked as removed.
   
4. **Update Salary by Name**:
   - Users can update the salary of a specific employee by entering their name.
   
5. **Close the Program**:
   - Exits the system.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (such as GCC)
- A terminal or command prompt

### Steps to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RawanArby/company-system.git
## Future Improvements
-Implement dynamic memory allocation for better efficiency.
-Improve data structure by using classes and vectors instead of arrays.
-Add a feature to update employee details other than salary.
-Enhance input validation to prevent invalid entries.
